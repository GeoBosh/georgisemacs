# Georgi's Emacs customisations

I will upload here selected Emacs code and customisations.

For now, [[http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~gb/emacs/index.html ][this page]] contains a couple of packages for typesetting mathematics and
text in Bulgarian and Russian.  For example, typing a single key 
adjust the current input method according to the surrounding context (I usually
assign this key to Capslock).
